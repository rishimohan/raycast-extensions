# Orshot

Orshot is an automated image generation platform. Orshot's Raycast extension lets you generate website and tweet screenshots

It uses Orshot's [Website Screenshot API](https://orshot.com/templates/website-screenshot) and [Tweet Screenshot API](https://orshot.com/templates/tweet-image) to generate the screenshots

## How to use

- Search `Orshot` in Raycast
- Select between "Create Website Screenshot" and "Create Tweet Screenshot"
- Enter Website or Tweet URL
- Hit enter, it'll generate and save the image to your chosen directory (Desktop by default)

Free usage is rate-limited based on your IP, and you can generate 10 screenshots per 3 minutes

You can get your API key from your [Orshot Dashboard](https://orshot.com) > Workspace Settings > API Key to generate more screenshots

## Preferences

- **API Key**: Optional API key to remove rate limits
- **Save Directory**: Choose where to save screenshots (defaults to Desktop)
